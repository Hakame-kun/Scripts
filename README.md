# About this Repository
It's a place where I backup/store my/your Roblox Scripts
# What Exploit/Executor that Support the Script ?
Most of the scripts that I store usually works with <a href="https://wearedevs.net/dinfo/Krnl" target="_blank">Krnl</a> 
and I just recommend <a href="https://wearedevs.net/dinfo/Krnl" target="_blank">Krnl</a> rather than 
<a href="https://wearedevs.net/dinfo/JJSploit" target="_blank">JJSploit</a>. Why ? Because, even if Krnl needs key to make it able to use, it simply can do any 
scripts, yeah Paid Script also works well with Krnl
