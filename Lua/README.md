# Loadstring
To use Lua script, you may need:
loadstring(game:HttpGet("ScriptURL", true))() -- Change the URL to the script source.<br>
<br>
For example: loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://github.com/Hakame-kun/Scripts/raw/main/Lua/Anti%20AFK.lua, true))()<br>
It must be a raw file to be executed, otherwise it won't work. You can see the script above, it contains '/raw/main/'.
