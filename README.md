# About this Repository
It's a place where I backup/store my/your Roblox Scripts.
# What Exploit/Executor that Support the Script ?
Most of the scripts that I store usually works with <a href="https://wearedevs.net/dinfo/Krnl" target="_blank">Krnl</a> 
and I just recommend <a href="https://wearedevs.net/dinfo/Krnl" target="_blank">Krnl</a> rather than 
<a href="https://wearedevs.net/dinfo/JJSploit" target="_blank">JJSploit</a>.<br>
Why ? Because, even if Krnl needs key to make it able to use, it simply can do any 
scripts, yeah Paid Script also works well with Krnl.
# Obfuscated Script and Open Source Folder
Obfuscated Script folder is a place where I made a script that used an obfuscator (Obfuscated Script) (to make sure the script won't get patched somehow). It will just work for 
some executors that can do obfuscated script, like <a href="https://wearedevs.net/dinfo/Krnl" target="_blank">Krnl</a> or above <a href="https://x.synapse.to/" target="_blank">Synapse X (Buy for $20, highly recommended)</a><br><br>
Open Source folder is a place where I made a script without obfuscator and most will work on any executor, if it doesn't work, try to use another executor. Otherwise you should use <a href="https://wearedevs.net/dinfo/Krnl" target="_blank">Krnl</a> or <a href="https://x.synapse.to/" target="_blank">Synapse X (Buy for $20, highly recommended)</a>. <br>
